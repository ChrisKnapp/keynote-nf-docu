Please, see https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/discussions/752 (Translating KeyNote NF)
On that page you will find information about available translations and how to prepare another one for any other language.

Before you start translating a language (if you are interested), I recommend that you indicate in the discussion for the
current version of KeyNote (example: #753 (Language Files. Version 2.0.0+)) your intention to start or update the 
translation for that language, in case someone else is considering the same thing, so that not several people do the same 
thing unknowingly, but in a collaborative manner.

In the keynote.lan file (that you will find in that page) there is information about the current translations, such as who did them.
