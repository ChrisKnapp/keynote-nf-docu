Notes: 
******
- BETA releases include normally only 'keynote.exe'. You must download previously a normal version and then
  replace .exe with the executable of the beta version. 

- Also, **and important**, the language files are associated to specific versions and so the language files
  will not be compatible with the beta executable. It is necessary that (in the meantime) you select
  'English (internal)' as language. You can do that from the application: 
      Tools -> Configuration options -> General settings -> Language
   or modifying keynote.ini:
     LanguageUI=English (Internal)
   or simply:
     LanguageUI=


HOW TO INSTALL/UPDATE
----------------------
KeyNote NF doesn't need installation to work. You can download the archive of the release-1.7.8, 
extract to a folder and then overwrite it with the files in the following archives:

    AND REMEMBER: 
      It is **always strongly recommended** to conserve backups of .knt files, 
      specially before upgrading to a new version. Note that from version 1.7.9 Beta 7, 
      a new option was added that offer the possibility of maintaining backups regularly.
      See #544: New option to keep backups at regular intervals (https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/544)
