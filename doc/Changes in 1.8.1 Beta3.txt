Changes in 1.8.1 Beta 3 (22 nov 2023)
=======================

* Fixed: KNT could get hang doing a Search (Find Next or Find All) [IMPORTANT]
  It would depend on the presence of several hidden marks in the editor (vinculated to new KNT links or images --since 1.8.1),
  the distance between them and the length of the search term...
  This error is present since version 1.8.0
  

* Fixed: Missing dot-separator on files saved in external image storage
  The problem is described here:
  https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/623#issuecomment-1819696740
  It seems that from some locales the expression 'FormatDateTime( 'ddMMM', Now)' used as part of the file name, adds
  a dot to the end and in others it doesn't. In the spanish locale it adds the point and I supposed that it was something general.
  Now the code does not depend on that (possible) dot to separate the extension. It constrols it explicitily

* Fixed: Control the elimination of hidden mark when using Right click on an visible image and selecting Delete
  As described here:
  https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/623#issuecomment-1820290308

* Fixed: Searches may not correctly highlight results when images are visible (if storage <> EmbeddedRTF)
  The positions calculated in the searches (Find All and Find Next) are based on the TextPlain obtained with the images hidden
  (the format used when saving notes/nodes). When all images are hidden (imLink mode), or there are no images, these positions
  allow matches to be highlighted directly, but when all or some of the images are visible in the editor it is necessary to
  adapt these positions, calculating the offset to be considered at the time when it is required to jump to or highlight a match.

 
* Images. Added new option to allow to decide whether or not to save images in subfolders
  Option: ImgSaveInSubfolders
  False by default. If True: in external storage, save files in subfolders, using the name of the note where the image is first added
  As requested in https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/623#issuecomment-1821957039

* Images. Added new option: Viewer - Single instance (ImgSingleViewerInstance)
  When ImgSingleViewerInstance = True [default], each image is shown in the same visible Viewer, if any,
  and the Viewer window's size is maintained, trying to show images at 100%, adapting to that size.
  If ImgSingleViewerInstance = False, it is possible to show several images simultaneously,
  resizing each window to try to show its image at 100%

* Images. Added new option: Viewer - Hot track (ImgHotTrackViewer)
  When ImgSingleViewerInstance = True and ImgHotTrackViewer is set, if the viewer is open, selecting or clicking
  in any image (or image link) will show the image in the viewer, maintaining the focus on the editor.
  Added a button in Viewer that lets makes it always visible (by default it will on)


* Review of some captions and hints in Keynote options related to images
    Allow to independently set 'Relative path in Linked files'

* Fixed: Double click on text could open image viewer with an random image

* Do not allow insert | URL... inside an existing Image link
