Changes in 1.8.1 Beta 6 (09 dec 2023)
=======================

* Images. Added new ini option: ImgViewerPath
  Allows to enter an absolute or relative (to keynote.exe) path to an external image viewer
  As requested in https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/623#issuecomment-1824929978

* Image viewer: added shortcuts for zoom and scrolling
	Zoom:
	 +  In
	 -  Out
	 *  100%
	 /  Adjust
	  (From Numpad. +, - : if used with Ctrl : greater zoom ratio )

	Scrolling:
	 Cursors      (if used with Ctrl : greater scrolling)

	 Prior, Next : Up/down edge
	 Home, End   : Left/right edge
	 Ctrl + Home : Upper left corner
	 Ctrl + End  : Lower right corner

	Notes:
	* The increments are greater on Zoom in than on Zoom out
	* Ctrl can also be used while clicking the zoom in and out buttons


* Fixed: Can be difficult to open images inside tables with the internal or an external viewer
  Problem described here: https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/623#issuecomment-1845791606
  It is possible to include images in the cells of a RTF table, but due to the behavior of the RichEdit control, it could be difficult
  to open the image (by double clicking, or Ctr+double clicking) because in many cases not only the image is being selected but other
  characters in the same cell or row of the board.
  It was possible to open it, trying again, but difficult. In hidden images mode (seeing the link to the image) this problem does not
  occur and has always worked correctly.
  The application is modified to identify and address this situation. Images contained in tables can now be opened normally.

  Important:
  Images contained in table cells cannot be resized manually, the RichEdit control does not allow it (can be checked with WordPad).
  Instead it will try to perform a drag and drop action. If the image is moved in this way, you will have to reposition it by cutting
  and pasting or dragging it again, as you will not be able to Undo.
  It is possible to modify the dimensions using the 'Restore image[s] proportions' option or by Alt+Click on the image button, while
  selecting this image. If you need to set a size at will and not depend on the 'Max auto. width on insert', perhaps the simplest thing
  is to cut and paste the image outside the table, resize it and then reposition it in the table.


* Improvements for profiles management | Profiles\Default | Profiles macros
	The following improvements have been incorporated to better organize the different files that are used in each profile/session
	(See the file 'Profiles.txt') :

	- If KeyNote detects the presence of the "Profiles\Default" subfolder within the folder with the executable (keynote.exe), it will
	  search in that subfolder for the keynote.ini file and the rest of the files (and if they do not exist, it will add them to that
	  folder according to is requiring it)
	  The setup program will establish that subfolder to promote better organization of the files, avoiding mixing and confusing those
	  files with the rest of the application files and with the configurations of other profiles. The rest of the profiles should also
	  be created within the "Profiles" folder. Ex: "Profiles\F9"
	  The setup program will appropriately set the permissions for the Profiles folder.

	- The notehead.rtf and nodehead.rtf files so far have not been specific to the profile configuration, but common to all.
	  From the new version it is possible to customize one or both files from a profile, adding them to the folder containing the
	  profile's .ini file. If one of these two files is not found in the profile folder, the application will use the one(s) located
	  in the main profile folder ("Profiles\Default" or the folder that contains the executable).

	- If within the folder with the .ini files there is a subfolder called 'macros' (e.g. "Profiles\F9\macros"), the macros contained
	  therein will be loaded, taking preference over those loaded from the main macro folder (<exe folder>\macros)
		- This allows to define different automatic execution macros in each configuration.
		- When recording new macros it is possible to create them as general or specific to the profile
