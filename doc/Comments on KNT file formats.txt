File formats in KeyNote NF. Native vs Compressed format / Use of IMAGES
=======================================================================

   - - - - -
   UPDATE
   Take a look at the file 'Images_Readme.txt'. Since version 1.8.1 it is not necessary to save the images in RTF, 
   in plain ASCII as hexadecimal values. Now can be saved in the image binary format, at the end of the .knt file,
   or as independent files, in an external folder or zip file.

To help decide which format may be the most suitable to use with KeyNote NF files, depending on the circumstances,
I have made a series of measurements that I show below.

I have started from a personal file without images, in which I have duplicated (using Merge Notes...) several of the 
largest notes. I have then created another file from that one, adding several images. What is interesting are the relative
differences in the times obtained. Anyway, for reference: I have used a 7200rpm HDD, on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4570 
desktop, running Windows 10.

I have used two files as a reference, comparing in both cases the times obtained when loading and saving the files,
considering the native format and three options of the compressed format: Max, Default, Fastest  

* Note: See the notes at the end regarding sizes after pasting images vs dragging images
   
In general terms I want to highlight the following:
---------------------------------------------------
 - Reading the file from disk and parsing it, loading the data model, without building the user interface objects, 
   requires very similar times in all formats.
   However, in the compressed format we have to add the time required to compress or decompress (note, it is much 
   more expensive to compress than to decompress). Something similar happens with the encrypted format, where you also
   have to add the time needed to encrypt or decrypt.   
      
 - When opening a file, what takes the most time is the creation and configuration of the different Tree Panels. See notes (*)
   I have in mind to use another control to improve this time and also make it possible to manage a larger number
   of nodes with a lighter memory footprint. Specifically, I am considering using Virtual TreeView, instead of actual
   one: TTreeNote.
 
 - It could be more convenient to use a compressed format instead of native format when the file contains images, 
   because of the way images are saved in RTF (at least in RichEdit control), in plain ASCII, as hexadecimal values.
   
 - The 'Default' option may be the most convenient if you need to compress a lot, since the size obtained is slightly 
   greater than that obtained with the 'Max' option and yet it can be much faster. But the 'Fastest' option can be a great
   compromise option, especially with very large files. You can easily quarter the file size on disk with very little time.   
   
 - If encrypting the file is a necessity, there is nothing more to say, it is a matter of using the available format
    
 - It is always strongly recommended to conserve backups of .knt files (and of all kind of files that we consider important)
   But If we use a compressed or encrypted format then it is also more important, because if the file got corrupted for
   any reason, it won't be able to be opened by KNT. Instead, in a native file, we could try to open with text editors
   like Notepad++, and perhaps we could recover some information (but this requires to know the internals of KeyNote...)  
   
   I personally would never discard using compressed format, if it was the best option on certain files, for that 
   hipothetic problem. I have been using the compressed format for a lot of years and never had any issue.   
   But of course, I always use the option 'Backup at regular intervals' (https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/544),
   so that I know that I will not end up overwriting the file with a corrupted file or with a file in wich a deleted 
   information by error. Besides, I always conserve backup of my personal files in local, on my NAS, and even in the 
   cloud (immediately in Dropbox, and periodically in Google Drive... ) :)

 - In coming versions there will be another approach to the way images are saved, more optimized, but in the meantime it 
   is important to consider this aspect, specially if we have large files with many images, or the files are saved to a
   network folder


---------------------------------------------------

 Test with "File 1"
 ---------------------
  File with 16 notes, 1604 nodes    
  No images. Almost all of the nodes in rich text, RTF
 
                 Disk size    Times in milliseconds
                              Load       Save
   - Native:      7.160 KB    1.141 (*)    15
   - Zip Max:     1.926 KB    1.187       531
   - Zip Default: 1.936 KB    1.218       375 
   - Zip Fast:    2.312 KB    1.187       141
   
   (*) As an example, in this case, reading and parsing the file, loading the data model, but without building the UI,
       takes only 47 ms
   

 Test with "File 2"
 ---------------------
  File identical to "File 1", to which I have pasted 2 images from the clipboard, obtained through screenshots.
 
  Saved independently to disk, the two images occupy:
   Img1:    PNG:   48 KB   GIF: 103 KB    JPG (quality 9/10):  107 KB     
    Capture of a file explorer window, with much of it blank. Inserted twice in the "File 2"
  
   Img2:    PNG: 3399 KB   GIF: 1262 KB   JPG (quality 9/10): 1201 KB     
     Capture an image of the desktop, with a black and white photo in the background
   
                 Disk size    Times in milliseconds
                              Load       Save      
   - Native:      27.569 KB   1.438 (*)     47 
   - Zip Max:      5.418 KB   1.593      2.422
   - Zip Default:  5.453 KB   1.547      1.328
   - Zip Fast:     6.828 KB   1.594        391

   (*) Reading and parsing the file, loading the data model, but without building the UI: 188 ms
   

 * NOTE - The sizes of "File 2", could be much smaller if the images had been dragged into the editor from files
  (for example, Img1.png  and Img2.jpg)
  
   - Native:       9.800 KB
   - Zip Max:      3.399 KB
   - Zip Default:  3.409 KB
   - Zip Fast:     3.837 KB


 IMAGES
 ------ 
  Note that in current versions of the RichEdit control it is possible to drag an image file into the editor
  (from the file explorer, for example) of any of the formats listed above.
  In these cases, the RichEdit control will save the image in a more optimized RTF format (the file will take up less space).
  It will still save the image as ASCII in hexadecimal format, but in many cases it will do so once compressed to JPG or PNG:
 
   PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF => png format (\pngblip)
   JPG => jpg format (\jpegblip)
   Capture from clipboard => windows meta file format (WMF) (\wmetafile8)
   
   This last format was the only one recognized by older versions (e.g., version 4, available in XP or W7), and it takes up 
   much more size than the rest (png or jpg).
