Changes in 1.8.3 .01  (29 dec 2023)
=================================

* Fixed: Paste operation could keep text selected in certain situations (see implications on ClipCap )
  In .knt files with new image storage mode (other than smEmbeddedRTF), when pasting RTF text in plain mode,
  the text could stay selected.
  As a result, if using ClipCap mode, the new copied text was replaced before pasting (in the ClipCap destination note)

* Improvement in Export: Added new tokens and options for note/node heading
  - When exporting the highest node level will be managed as 1, the next as 2, and so on.
  - Added three new tokens:
	%^  -> line break
	%>  -> add symbols until heading reach a calculated length, based on level (decreasing)
	%<  -> add symbols based on level (increasing)

	And five new options:
	- NodeLevelTemplates
	  Enable the use of node templates based on level, of the form 'nodehead_1.rtf', 'nodehead_2.rtf'

	- SymbolsInHeading
	  Determines which symbols to repeat in the %> and %< tokens

	- LengthsHeading
	  Text string that determines the number of repetitions of the symbol corresponding to the level to be used with the %> token.
	  It is defined from a length to be obtained for the header at the level, using a maximum value, a decrement and a minimum value.

	- AutoFontSizesInHeading
	  Enables setting the font size automatically, from the following option:

	- FontSizesInHeading
	  String that determines the font size to use in a header according to its level (also considering the note), using a maximum value, a decrement and a minimum value

* Export Improvement: Added new options for indenting nested nodes
   Added two general export options:
	- Indent nodes
	  Enable the indentation of nested nodes

	- Indents by
	  Value to be used, in a incrementally way, with each new level.
	  This value is similar to the one used as general configuration in "Increment indents by", in
	  Tools|Configuration Options..|Rich Text editor

	 Added screenshots in https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/573#issuecomment-1871124640

   And another two options for exporting indenting nested nodes in plain text:
	- IndentUsingTabs
	  If checked, the indentation will be with the TAB (#9) characters. If unchecked, multiple spaces
	  will be used for each level of indentation. The number of spaces to use if not checked will be the
	  one define in "Tab size", in the Note properties.

	- NumbTabInPlainText   [only editable in .INI file]
	  Allows replacing the TAB character always used when pasting numbering lists as plain text
	 (system conversion) by an alternative string. By default a space " " is defined.

	The paragraphs of each node will be indented by the value defined in "Indent by" multiplied with
	its node level,	added to the indentation they may have (as it is done when exporting to other formats).
	The resulting value, together with "Increment indents by" (in Tools | Configuration Options.. | Rich Text editor)
	isused to determine how much 'tabs' to apply:
	  Number of 'tabs' = [Indentation value] div [Increment indents by]

	  Ex. Suppose [Increment indents by] = 12 and a paragraph in a node of level 2, not previously indented:
		   if [Indents by] = 24  => (0 + (24*2))/12  => indented with 4 'tabs'  (2 'tabs' for each level)

		 If the paragraph was previously indented with a value of 14:
		   if [Indents by] = 24  => (14 + (24*2))/12  => indented with 5 'tabs' (2 'tabs' for each level + extra tab)

 	Added example screenshots in https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/573#issuecomment-1871872205


* BulletsInPlainText (.INI) now defaults to '- '

* Image Viewer now allows to scroll through the images of the current node (or note)
  By default, navigation toolbar buttons will show previous or next image instance in the node (or note)
  where the selected image is inserted
  If click with CTRL then it will show image with previous or next ID (in the whole .knt file)
  As described here: https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/623#issuecomment-1826281735

* Improvement: ApplyStyle can now be reverted with just 1 or 2 undo operations
  Currently, to revert a combined style applied (font and paragraph) 18 undo operations where needed

* Corrected TAB order in Paragraph form
  
* Fixed: Pasting format could hide the text where it was applied, if copied from a line starting with a hyperlink
  Suppose a line beginning with a hyperlink:
     MyHyperlink		 Normal Text, no in the hyperlink
     Target text

   If we copied the format from the first line, starting from the beginning of the line, and then pasted that
   format over another text (eg. "Target text"), that target text aparently was removed. Was not removed, but hidden...
