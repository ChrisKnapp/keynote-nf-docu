Changes in 1.9.5 .01  (17 may. 2024)
===================================

* New: Hyperlinks can use parameters, behaving similar to Favorites

  This way you can organize favorites as you want inside notes.

  Added two new INI options:
  - URLFileSepParams: If not empty, it allows to specify parameters in hyperlinks, after those characters
     It is defined by default as '##', but can be replaced with other character/s with some exceptions.
	 You can use for example '==' or '<=' but not '<', '<<', '>>' or '>='. Some of these strings should
	 not be used because they are problematic if you try to use them in plain notes. Others simply don't
	 work even in RTF	notes.
	 Before changing this option you can test if can be used normally including it in an URL
	 (in RTF and Plan Text -if you use plain text)

  - URLFileSpaceInParams: If not empty, it allows the use of spaces in hyperlinks of plain notes (where spaces
     can only be used in the program/document part, and most times only if enclosed between < and >)
     This option will be ignored in RTF notes, because there you can use spaces normally in hyperlinks.
	 It is defined by default as '+'

  Note:
  - You can use quotation marks (") to enclose parameters, but note that they will be converted to single
  quotation marks internally in the URL. In case you type the URLs 'manually' in the editor without the help
  of Insert|URL or 'Choose Action for Hyperlink' dialogs, you have to type '' instead of ".
  - You can use spaces in the parameters part, also after characters defined by URLFileSepParams.
   But you can use spaces before that characters only in hyperlinks of RTF notes.

  Examples. The following command:
     E:\Output\bin\keynote.exe  Profiles\F9\keynote.ini -dnd "E:\Path\With spaces\myFile.knt" -title"MY TITLE"

  Can be introduced in a hyperlink of a RTF note using "Insert|URL" and "Choose Action for Hyperlink" dialogs typing:
     E:\Output\bin\keynote.exe ## Profiles\F9\keynote.ini -dnd "E:\Path\With spaces\myFile.knt" -title"MY TITLE"
   or
	 E:\Output\bin\keynote.exe##Profiles\F9\keynote.ini -dnd "E:\Path\With spaces\myFile.knt" -title"MY TITLE"

   or, eg., if using '<=' as params separator:
    E:\Output\bin\keynote.exe <= Profiles\F9\keynote.ini -dnd "E:\Path\With spaces\myFile.knt" -title"MY TITLE"

  In a plain text note, you can write the same in "Insert|URL" and "Choose Action for Hyperlink" dialogs, but without
  spaces before the parameters separator. Ex:
   OK:   E:\Output\bin\keynote.exe<= Profiles\F9\keynote.ini -dnd "E:\Path\With spaces\myFile.knt" -title"MY TITLE"
   BAD:  E:\Output\bin\keynote.exe <= Profiles\F9\keynote.ini -dnd "E:\Path\With spaces\myFile.knt" -title"MY TITLE"

  Once introduced in the dialogs, the URL will be inserted and visible in the plain note as:
   file:///E:\Output\bin\keynote.exe<=+Profiles\F9\keynote.ini+-dnd+''E:\Path\With spaces\myFile.knt''+-title''MY+TITLE''

  Note that you can write that last internal directly in a plain text editor, but you cannot in in a RTF note,
  because of the presence of spaces. By design, spaces will not be modified in hyperlinks of RTF notes and so
  you can use the character[s] defined in URLFileSpaceInParams inside any part of the parameters in hyperlinks
  of RTF notes.

* Added a new INI option: URLWebDecode to adapt URLs with %XY characters

  If True (1) it will manage %XX in URL as UTF8, finally converting the whole URL to ANSI or UTF8
  depending on current codepage

  Example:
   https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B0,_%D0%9B%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B5_%D0%B4%D0%B5
   ->
   https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Вега,_Лопе_де

   Certain characters that could be encoded with %XX won't be converted:
    ' ', '/', '?','!','''', '&', '%', '#', '$', '[', ']', '(',')', ',', ';', '*', ':', '@', '=', '+'

  Ex: http://www.example.com/space%20here.html won't be modified

  On "Insert URL" and "Choose Action for URL" dialogs, although URLWebDecode=1, you can force the URL not to be
  modified pressing Shift when exiting URL field, or when clicking on OK (Insert URL) or Modify (Choose Action for URL).
  Even if URL is not modified (because of Shift or URLWebDecode=0), when text is empty or equal to URL it will be set
  with the decoded version of the URL field.
  So, for example, if you pressed Shift while changing focus from "URL" to "Text", the URL field will maintain the %XY
  characters, but the "Text" field will be set decoded. In the example, this way you can automatically have:
    URL: https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B0,_%D0%9B%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B5_%D0%B4%D0%B5
   Text: https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Вега,_Лопе_де

  When using ClipCap or Web Copy (Ctrl+W or Ctrl+Shift+W), the clip URL will be automatically adapted if URLWebDecode = 1.
  Any other pasted hyperlinks, interspersed in the text, will be adapted only by opening and modifying via the
  "Choose Action for URL" dialog box.

* Fixed: Copy/Paste from web browsers did not work on systems with multi-byte character set (eg. Russian, codepage 1251)
  This affected, for example, to Cyrillic text
  It will now work regardless of whether UTF8 is the default codepage in your local/regional settings.

* Handle possible exception in Windows 8.1 when trying to open the Font dialog
  A change was made in version 1.9.1, in response to issue #613, that could be affecting negatively when
  executing KeyNote in Windows 8.1:

  Fixed: Setting the font size with the Font dialog when using scaling settings other than 100% results in a larger font than expected
  --
  There is an issue with TFontDialog in Delphi when using scaling settings other than 100%. This issue can cause the selected font to
  appear larger than expected.
  The problem lies in how TFontDialog (and, in fact, the underlying Win32 ChooseFont API) handles DPI awareness.

  I suspect that maybe the change made, which works perfectly in W10 and W11, might not be compatible with W8.1
  On Issue #618 it is confirmed that the exception that appears when opening the Fonts dialog (in W8.1) does not occur
  in version 1.9.0 (last version before the change)

* Fixed: Tree panel width could be reduced on restart (if it was wide enough)
  KeyNote checks the width of the tree at startup to make sure it is > 30 and < Pages.Width-30,
  but when this is done, the window has not yet been resized to its final size.
  This verification is removed as it seems unnecessary.

* Fixed: "F1" key cannot be used for any shortcut
  Now it can be used in combination with one or several modification key (ex: Alt+F1, Ctrl+F1, Shift+Ctrl+F1, ...)
