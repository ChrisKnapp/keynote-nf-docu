Changes in 1.8.2 .01  (23 dec 2023)
=================================

* New: Added options in treeview context menu to hide/show child nodes based on checked status
	Treeview context menu now includes:
	 Children Checkboxes
	   Show Checkboxes
	   ----------
	   Hide Checked
	   Hide Unchecked
	   Show non filtered

	"Hide Checked" and "Hide Unchecked" apply only to current state of children nodes. "Show non filtered" will restore visibility of
	children nodes that have not been filtered by a search.

	By the opposite, "Hide Checked Nodes" (Menu or toolbar button) dynamically hide all checked nodes in the note (as usual).

	The hint associated to "Hide Checked Nodes" now indicates: "Keep checked nodes hidden / Show non filtered [Ctrl]", to
	highlight the dynamic behavior of this action, and to remember that when clicked with Ctrl it will ensure that all non filtered
	nodes in the note will be shown (even if "Hide Checked Nodes" is currently not marked). This is useful to restore visibility of all
	nodes (in note) hidden with 'Hide Checked' or 'Hide Unchecked'

	Another difference: when saving, Keynote remembers the status of "Hide Checked Nodes", but not what was hidden using 'Hide Checked'
	or 'Hide Unchecked', which will be considered temporary.

* Improvement in Find All. Added 'Check mode', with three options:
 - 'Only non checked nodes'
 - 'Only checked nodes'
 - 'All'

* Improvement in Find All: replaced 'Search node names' option with 'Search Scope'
	Checkbox option 'Search node names' is replaced with a radiogroup of three options:
	- Only node names
	- Only note contents
	- All
	It is therefore now possible to restrict searches to node names

* Improvement in Find All. Matches in node names are highlighted in results list, with background color

* Improvement: Find All. All search types apply with 'Search node names'
	Match of a node name will consider now any of the possible options, and not only the first one:
	 - Exact phrase,
	 - All the words
	 - Any of the words

* Fixed: Find All. Consider option 'Whole words only' when selected 'Search node names'

-------------------
* Images. New: Ctr+Click on View Images (menu and toolbar button) -> Reapply hidden if Images Mode is imLink (images hidden)
	Until now, clicking with CTRL on the button forced the reload of the images in the editor, to allow reconsider from disk
	those images edited externally (having already been uploaded/cached).
	This function now applies only if Images Mode is imImage (images are displayed). If Images Mode is imLink (images are not
	displayed) it will now force any images that may be visible to be hidden.

	This is useful if you are inserting many images and need to hide them from time to time. Even if the Mode is imLink,
	added images are always shown.
	It is now possible to hide these new images without having to previously show all the others.

* Fixed: Caret position after changing images visibility / Fixed: Bug in Find Next with images
	- After changing the visibility of images, the cursor position was being reset to 0
	- In certain situations, searches with "Find Next" on editor with images could work incorrectly.

* Fixed: Image viewer could not show scroll bars when zooming on certain occasions

* Fixed: Clipboard capture was ignoring images
  Indicated in issue #448

---------------
* Improvement: When jumping to a location (eg. click on a hyperlink), show the destination on the first line of the editor

---------------

* Fixed: Pressing left or backspace on the first character of a cell in a table raised an exception
	The exception could be ignored without further consequences. But it became impossible to edit the beginning of the cells

* Fixed: Eliminated flickering when displaying the search screen (Find Next)
	It was only happening when the "Search for word at cursor" option was activated (WordAtCursor)
	It also happened when executing "Select word"

* Fixed: When deleting a node, the new (automatically) selected node was not showing with correct zoom, nor was updated the status bar


* Fixed: Non controlled exception "FORMATEC structure not valid" on Paste Special... pasting from certain pages
  The conversion from HTML to RTF may be incorrect on some pages and cause an exception on the previous line
  for example returning the message "FORMATEC structure not valid"

* Fixed: "FORMATEC structure not valid" exception pasting from certain pages
	The conversion from HTML to RTF may be incorrect on some pages and cause an exception on the previous line
	for example returning the message "FORMATEC structure not valid"
	This happens, for example, when you copy and paste the first answer that appears on this page:
