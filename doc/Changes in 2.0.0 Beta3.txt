Changes in 2.0.0 Beta 3  (29 oct 2024)
=======================

* Added accessibility to the Virtual TreeView control (used in tree panel, file manager and config.options)

  Used a unit called VirtualTrees.Accessibility that implements IAccessible interfaces for the VirtualTree visual
  components and the currently focused node.
  To be able to read and recognize not only focused node but also any of the nodes when we place the cursor
  over them, I have modified that unit: ui\VirtualTrees.Accessibility_MOD.pas

  This allows the NVDA screen reader to read and recognize the tree nodes when you place the cursor over them,
  and also when you go down or up the node tree with the arrows.

----- 
* (Accessibility) Added new .INI option, to facilitate reading Hints through the status bar

  It is not the best solution but for now I have not managed to find a reasonable way to offer through
  accessibility (IAccessibity) the hints that the application shows through the multiple controls that
  it has.
  For now and given that when the status bar is visible the hints are shown in one of its panels,
  and having verified that readers such as NVDA offer key combinations to read the content of the status
  bar, I have seen it convenient (using the new option) to make all the text panels of the status bar,
  except for the one corresponding to the Hint, be shown empty, so that the screen reader can directly
  read the text (the hint) without having to previously read all the other panels, which include the file
  name, cursor position, file modification status, etc.
  For example, the NVDA reader allows reading the status bar with the combination [NVDA]+End.

  The option is "HintsAccesible". Just add it to the .INI file in the [KeyOptions] section.
  If it is not added (default situation), or is set to zero, the behavior will be the same as always.
  To obtain the new behavior, it must be added and set to 1. Ex:

  [KeyOptions]
  HintsAccesible=1

  NVDA (Non-Visual Desktop Access) allows blind and vision impaired people to access and interact with
  the Windows operating system and many third party applications.
