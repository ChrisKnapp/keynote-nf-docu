Changes in 1.8.1 Beta 5 (02 dec 2023)
=======================

* Fixed: Ensure that the hidden mark accompanies its image in the event that it moves by dragging
  Problem described here:  https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/623#issuecomment-1834392261

* Fixed: Image could be duplicated on storage (with new ID) after pasting an image previously copied or cut to clipboard
  The reason for this duplicity is explained here:  https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/623#issuecomment-1834392261
  Despite the latest corrections made, this problem could still occur when pasting an already registered image from
  the clipboard, previously copied or cut.
  - It was not controlled that the size of the RTF string constructed by the application from the image stream could be 
  greater than that available from the clipboard, because the RichEdit control will have eliminated the following 
  information if it was present:  Embedded color profile, EXIF metadata, IPTC metadata
  - Among the consequences: the hidden mark was not being added, so it would end up being interpreted as another image.
  Besides, data could be being copied beyond the reserved buffer (In debug mode a Range check error exception is 
  generated...), which it could be causing other errors that are more difficult to detect.

* Fixed: Insert | Image... was inserting images considering the 'Link to files by default' option on the contrary


* Images. Added "Restore image[s] proportions" to the RTF context menu
    As requested here: https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/623#issuecomment-1830661325
  - The new action will reset proportions and reconsider "Max.auto width" on selected image[s].
    If there is no selection, it will modify all images in the editor.
  - The functionality of the Alt+Click (on toolbar image button) has also been expanded to allow
    acting only on the selection, if any.
  - As before, the resizing done with Alt-click, when it is applied to all images in the Editor
    (with no selection) is temporary by default: if the node has no modifications, its status will
    not change, it will continue to remain unmodified and these changes will not will be saved.
    But if you want to keep them, just make any minimal change to the node (such as adding or
    removing a space...), to mark the node (or note) as modified.
    But when applied to a selection, the changes will mark the node (or note) as modified. In this
    case, the changes in the images can be reverted with Undo operation.
  - The new action, "Restore image[s] proportions", by the opposite, will always mark the node/note
    as modified, even when applied to all images in the editor. Changes can also be reverted with
    Undo operation.

* Images. Added new option: 'Keep original file name' (ImgKeepOrigName)
  With the functionality described here as the second option:
  https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/623#issuecomment-1825998802
  Notes:
  - When using File | Insert Picture..., and a file with the same name already exists, the modal window used
    when dropping a file will be offered, to show the proposed new file name.
  - If several images are dragged and there are some file/s with a name used, a label will be shown giving
    a warning. If continue inserting, that files will be automatically renamed.

* Images. Revised internal visor layout. Added 'Compact' check

* Images. Change in options layout
