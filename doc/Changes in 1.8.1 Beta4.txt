Changes in 1.8.1 Beta 4 (27 nov 2023)
=======================

* Fixed: Inserting high resolution images for 100% viewing does not add the images
  As it is described in https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/623#issuecomment-1824896077
  and https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/623#issuecomment-1824370437
  It seems that the RichEdit control supports a maximum visible value, in any of the dimensions (x or y)
  of approx. 32760 twips (2184 pixels) (1 pixel=15 twips).
  Now KNT will consider that limit of 32760 twips. If it is exceeded in any dimension, it will be limited to that value, 
  proportionally reducing the other.

* Images. Better error handling
  Trying to avoid the problems described here:
  https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/623#issuecomment-1824896077

* Images. Not obtaining the dimensions from the RTF when we can (and need) handle the content of the image.
  The image header in RTF tells us, through its labels \picw and \pich values that do not correspond to the real size
  of the image (at least in formats distinct to wmetafile8, like jpg), but are equivalent to those of the visible dimensions
  (\picwgoal and \pichgoal ). If we use these values we will be registering an image with incorrect dimension values,
  and thus we will show it in the internal viewer when we do it 100%.

* Images. Alt+Click on Image toolbutton: Reconsider 'Max.auto width'
  It allows to resize the images, respecting the original proportions, adjusting the dimensions as indicated in the
  'Max.auto width' configuration option.
  It is applied only to the images of the active node/note.

* Images. Ctrl+Click on Image toolbutton: Force reload of external images
  In case the image was modified externally. 
  It is applied only to the images of the active node/note.

* Images. Don't add line breaks when inserting individual images
  Separation lines are only added in the case of inserting several images at the same time

* Images. Changing cursor to HourGlass while converting storage mode

* Image viewer: AlwaysVisible <-False is needed to show warning

* Fixed: Images. Couldn't save new files if initially changed its storage format from default

* Fixed: Exporting to EmbeddedKNT with images no available
  When serializing the images that must remain embedded in the KNT file, for example when
  exporting the file with File | Copy To.. we must control that certain images could be an unavailable

* Images. Review and optimization in the use of AnsiStrings
* Images. Review and optimization in the use of null-terminated strings
