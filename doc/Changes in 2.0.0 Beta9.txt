Changes in 2.0.0 Beta 9  (01 dec 2024)
=======================

* Fixed: In certain cases, when expanding the tree (fully or partially), the last node is cut off
  Was fixed this problem when first detected but it was not totally resolved
  (as shown in https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/discussions/739#discussioncomment-11381762)
  Now a different approach has been used that it seems better (and simpler).

* Fixed: Defaults. Clicking on text "Default plain text..." doesn't change checkbox
  Ref: https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/discussions/739#discussioncomment-11415492

* Fixed: hyperlinks without explicit protocol and with @ character were always interpreted as emails (mailto:...)
  Consider this case: "D:\@Developers\Path\file.txt"

* Fixed: Allow use of UTF8 text in Lang\keynote.lan (and so in the language name list)

* Fixed: Translation of some drop-down lists was ignored

* Converted the texts displayed in the Help buttons of the Folder Properties dialog box to resource strings
  To allow their translation

* Fixed: When another app modified the knt file, it could be marked as Modified before asking 'Reload the file from disk?'

* Fixed: Alarms. Adjusted calendar control to required size based on locale
  The Arabic calendar, for example, can be much wider than the Gregorian calendar used
  with the Spanish or English regional settings.

* Fixed: Exception in some systems with non-Gregorian calendar (ECommonCalendarError)
  There is a bug in Delphi, and it does not handle certain calendars correctly, such as the Um-Al-Qura Calendar
  used in Saudi Arabia.
  This error appears in previous versions of KeyNote, such as 1.9.5.2, when opening the alarms window,
  but since TDateTimePicker controls have been incorporated into the search panel, the error can directly
  prevent the application from opening.

* Changed fonts in Main window from MS Sans Serif to Tahoma
  Changed default fonts, in tree and editor, to Tahoma 11

* Fixed: Changed 'NoteState' token ("NS" -> "Ns")
  This will force any "NS" tokens loaded as 'NoteState' to be discarded and not saved for now.
  It does not affect files saved up to now with versions 2.0.0 Beta because in these versions
  the NoteState values are not yet being used.
  On the contrary, some of those defined in NoteEntryState, which was also configured as "NS",
  are being used.

* Fixed: Internally, the ID associated with each note entry is not being 0, as it should be.
  This has no impact at the moment, other than a few more bytes being written to the .knt file for each note.
  It is fixed with the new version Beta 9 and the .knt file will no longer write those unnecessary values.
  Since version 2.0 the model supports multiple "entries" for each note. Each entry has an ID, which starts
  at zero. However, both files created with earlier versions are converted to notes with a single entry,
  and it is still only possible to create one entry in the current 2.0.0 versions

* Updated .LNG files to be translated
* Updated Help file
