Changes in 2.0.1 .01     (15 dec 2024)
====================

* Fixed: Exception in Alarms form when changing the list of displayed alarms (create new, sort or change visible mode)

- - - -
* Fixed: Page Setup Crash and other problems with Printing  (Ref: #647)

  The use of RichPrinting, an old third party component, included in KeyNote 1.6.5, is deprecated.
  Removed 'Safe print mode' option
  It is possible to print the current node or all nodes in the folder, either side by side or starting each node
  on a new page.
  Among other things, this now allows PDFs to be generated correctly.

  I'm disabling Print Preview for now (I'll re-enable it soon, in a more correct way). Also, more features
  will also be added to printing.

* Fixed: Tree right-click context menu not showing (mainly after double-clicking a node)
  Ref: #777
  See also: https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/discussions/739#discussioncomment-11359035

  To avoid interference with menu shortcuts (such as those associated with Delete or Ins) it is necessary to unassign the context 
  menu when editing a node   starts, and to re-assign it when it is finished.
  The problem was caused by starting an editing operation for which no confirmation of completion was received.
  As a consequence of the control remaining without having the context menu assigned, many actions could not be executed,
  since the commands that are executed with the keyboard do so by virtue of the existence of shortcuts linked to the menu.

* Improved hot color (tree link) choice
  Ref: #747
  The color selection is still done automatically, but in a more correct way.

- - - -
* Processing of "NT" token is included, where node creation and modification dates were registered in old version 1.6.9

  NT=YYYYMMDDtHHMMSS.YYYYMMDDtHHMMSS
  Example: NT=20200113T115321.20241211T115236

* Updated *_WRK.LNG files ([work] translation files)

  -> Fixed: The images tab in the settings options and the keyboard shortcut configuration form are not available for translation
     Ref: #744(Some dialog boxes are not translated)
  -> New strings to be translated (related to configuration of text file extensions)

   Changes:

    (Make sure the line with KDL*Mark* has that code, 65100)

* Functionality exposed from kntutils.dll is now included in keynote.exe (kntutils.dll is no longer needed)
  This will increase the .exe file by just under 120kb, but it will no longer be necessary to use kntutils.dll (2491Kb).
  The included code is used to be able to configure the keyboard shortcuts as well as perform conversions between HTML and RTF
  (in both directions), depending on the selected import/export method.

* Corrected alignment of label 'Event or Expiration time', in Alarms form
* Using a resource file (.RES) to avoid the problem of IDs assigned to resource strings being modified and invalidating translations in .LNG files
