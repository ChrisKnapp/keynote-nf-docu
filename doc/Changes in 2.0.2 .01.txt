Changes in 2.0.2 .01     (09 jan 2025)
====================

* Added support for RTL (Right to left) languages

 - Shortcuts Ctrl-right+Shift-right and Ctr-left+Shift-left are again available to change current or selected paragraphs
   between RTL (Ctrl-right+Shift-right) or LTR (Ctr-left+Shift-left).
   These shortcuts were available in 1.9.5, but its use could interfere with other shortcuts including Ctrl and Shift
   (like Ctrl+Shift+F11 or the one used as HotKey -usually Ctrl+Shift+F12, for example). After executing the desired
   shortcut, CtrlR+ShiftR or CtrlL+ShiftL could also be executed, marking the file as modified (and changing the RTL/LTR
   status of the paragraph).
   Now those problems have been solved.

 - A new entry have been added to the editor's context menu: Reading from right to left (RTL).
   It is equivalent to using Ctrl-right+Shift-right and Ctr-left+Shift-left.

 - A new Folder level option have been included, "RTL (Right to Left)", that defines default bidirectional mode for tree
   and editor in folder. If set to True then the tree will be displayed as RTL, the editor will be set to RightToLeftNoAlign,
   and also new notes will start an RTL paragraph by default.

 - The entire interface will be adapted to RTL (*)(**) if the configured UI language (according a translated .LNG file) is
   defined as RTL. A new property have been added to the keynote.lan for each language to indicate if should be managed
   as RTL. The property is "RTL" (1 or 0)

   (*) The tree and the editor will depend on the folder level option, instead.
      It would be possible to see the menus in RTL and at the same time the content of some trees in RTL and others in LTR,
      which may be of interest depending on the content of the trees.

  (**) In order for it to display correctly, with controls aligned properly, etc., I'll still need to make some adjustments.

  - Adjusted the layout of Folder properties dialog (F4/F6) to allow translation to an RTL language

PRINT AND EXPORT IMPROVEMENTS

* KNT internal links are now converted to standard RTF format (works with MS Word and LibreOffice)
  This way hyperlinks pointing to other locations in the document will work.
  For example in Word you can Ctrl+Click to follow a link (It also works Alt+Left to return to the initial position)
  Using those editors editors you can save your RTF generated file to PDF format, with working links.

  - Internal links without marker are also converted to standard RTF format. These are links created with versions of 
    KeyNote prior to 1.8.0, where markers were not used to identify the destination, but only the position

  - The exported document can be opened in WordPad but internal links won't work, because WordPad
    doesn't recognize that kind of links (WordPad uses a limited subset of the Rich Text Format specification)
    * If the exported document is modified and saved from WordPad, the data attached to the links
      and the bookmarks themselves will be lost.

- - -
* Enabled (and redesigned) File | Print Preview
 - Use of existing image viewer
 - The shortcuts offered by the viewer are expanded:
   if the image is displayed in full, clicking Home, End, Prior or Next moves between images in the note (or pages in the print preview).
   
* Page numbering is added to File|Print... and File|Print Preview

- - -
* Added "Printer (PDF, ...)" as a new target format in File | Export...
  This allows to use all the functionality currently available for export when printing, either to paper (printer) or to PDF (eg.).

* Export. New options:
  * Table of Contents (with standard RTF links)	
    The maximum depth of the tree hierarchy can be configured.
	
  * Use of Sections
    By using sections it is possible to create groupings of notes with a defined maximum depth level. Seen another way, each time
	a note with a depth equal to or less than the set value is processed a new section is started. If you enable the use of sections
	you will be able to:
    - Decide whether the section will start on a new page or be saved in a separate file (one of two alternatives)
     (When printing, the only possible option, automatically selected, will be to start each section on a new page)

    - Set a section-dependent page header
      By default, the name of the highest level node on which the node depends (and which is included in the export) will be used 
	  as the page header. It is possible to define, through the option "Top N levels as Page Header (in sections)", the level of 
	  detail in the header, adding the name of other lower level parent nodes.
      The value set for the number of levels in the page header may be less than or equal to the depth indicated for the section
      The use of page headers is available both when exporting to RTF and when printing and previewing.

    In current version, when exporting keynote folders, you could choose to put all nodes to a single target file, or to export each 
	tree node to a separate target file. Now it is also possible with the use of sections; you only have to define a depth value equal
	or higher than the level of the deepest node you want to consider.

  * Start each Note on a new Page
    Allows all notes to start on a new page. This option is only available for RTF export and printing, and can be activated
	independently of using sections or the "Save each Folder to a new File" option.

  * Save each Folder to a new File
    When you include notes from more than one folder as the export source, if you activate the "Save each Folder to a new File" 
	option, a file will be generated for each folder to be exported. Otherwise, all of them will be exported to a single file 
	(unless sections are being used and these are saved to disk)..
    This option can only be selected if sections are not used or are not configured by setting "Save each Section to a new File".

  * Insert page number as Footer
  
  * Body Font
    Allows to customize the font of the entire exported document (name and size, without changing the font style such as bold or italics).
    With this option you can generate a document with a uniform and neat appearance

* Also: 
  - Was ignoring 'Font Sizes' when selected 'Export each note to a separated target file'
  - Other improvements to the export process, such as the way file names are generated.

- - - -
* Added "cintanotes:" as a new URL scheme (Ref: #775)

- - - - - - - - - 
* Fixed: After importing a TreePad file, there were no nodes visible
  Ref: #782

* Find All panel: Change in layout  (Ref: #787)

* Fixed: Some words marked as target for bookmarks could be [partially] ignored when removing hidden marks   (ex: exporting to RTF)
  Besides when exporting to RTF or HTML, it also could be detected: copying a text including that bookmark
  and pasting it into another program. In the process of removing hidden bookmarks, a word (or fraction) could be ignored.
  For example, in note "Image management in KeyNote NF" in Help, if we copied the text that includes "Compression and
  encryption" (selecting also text before), and paste outside of it the text pasted was "ssion and encryption" instead of
  "Compression and encryption"
