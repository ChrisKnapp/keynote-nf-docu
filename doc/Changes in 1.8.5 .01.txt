Changes in 1.8.5 .01  (03 feb 2024)
=================================

* Fixed issue #644: Export Notes Crash - Error Message and Application Freeze During Text Notes Export
  Although the bug describe in issue #644 was fixed in the commit (Fixed some bugs related to Export and UNICODE),
  included in this 1.8.5 version, this changes introduce some controls to avoid the consequences of that bug
  (a runaway pointer)

* Fixed issue #642: KeyNote disappear after select 'Cancel' in the confirmation message box for exit with unsaved modification
  The program continued to function normally, but hidden...

* Improved Bookmarks 0-9: Now are persisted, and are linked to target through a hidden mark
   Using the same mechanism that Keynote's Mark/Insert Location is based on, we can now use the 9 auxiliary markers:
	- Search|Set Bookmark (Shift+Alt+[0-9])
	- Search|Jump to Bookmark (Alt+[0-9])

   As before, the markers are global to the entire knt file.
   These markers are saved within the file, as well as the small hidden markers used as target.

   Tip: When using the keyboard shortcut Shift+Alt+[0-9] it may be convenient to use the ring and
    index fingers of the left hand (4 and 2, according to piano terminology), although it is also 
    possible to assign other shortcuts.

* Glossary: shortcuts formed exclusively by non alphanumeric characters will be automatically recognized
   We can expand "--" to "—", for example, using F7. It is not necessary to select previously those two
   characters. KeyNote will first try to find a term in glossary considering spaces (' ', tab and break
   lines) as word delimiters. If it does not find any terms, it will repeat the search considering any
   non-alphanumeric character as a word delimiter (as usual)

   So, if we have, "--" -> "—"   and "eg" -> "Example", then:
   "--eg" --> "--Example"
   If we also had "--eg" -> "EXAMPLE", then
	"--eg" --> "--EXAMPLE"
	"-- eg" --> "-- Example"

   We can define something like "*10" -> "*********"

* Revised behavior of color selection buttons
 - Added hint to "Other colors.." button to remember to right click on custom colors buttons to set or 
   modify them
 - When selected a color from "Other colors.." button, besides assigning that color to the Other color
   button (in the left down corner), that color will be automatically applied, as if you click on it.
 - Modifications in custom colors set will be saved even you don't click any of them


* Fixed: When navigating back in the history to another Editor (node or note), try to keep visible position
  It adjusts sligthly the change in version 1.8.2:
  - When jumping to a location (eg. click on a hyperlink), show the destination on the first line of the editor

* Adjustment in history navigation
  Currently it could add some unnecessary "history point" when activating an internal Keynote link
  (or using an auxiliary bookmark (0-9))

  For example, being 'Node 1' the selected node in "Note B", and "Note A" the selected note, after
  jumping with a internal knt link  to 'Node 2' in "Note B", navigating back should return to Note A
  and not to 'Node 1' in Note B.

* Fixed: Exception navigating history to a deleted node


* Fixed: When pasting from clipboard, RTF should be prioritized over image
  This should resolve issue #640 "Content copied from MS PowerPoint will be pasted as graph"
  Pasting from Excel also happened, for example. Now, if you copy a range of Excel cells,
  will be pasted as a table (RTF). If we want to paste as image, we can use Paste Other.

* Fixed: TAB multiple lines (#31) didn't work in plain text notes


* Fixed some bugs related to Export and UNICODE (see details)
 - Right-click on the node -> Export
   - Exporting from plain text to RTF and HTML failed

 - File | Export...
   - Exporting from plain text to RTF and HTML failed
   - Exporting from RTF was not successful if the system codepage was UTF8 (65001)
    (In W10 that codepage is enabled with the option "Beta: Use Unicode UTF- 8 for worldwide language support"

   That current codepage in then system can be consulted by looking in the Windows registry, for example with the
   following instruction from the command line (CMD):
    REG QUERY "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Nls\CodePage" -v ACP | find /I "ACP"

   The modification of the codepage can be done from the Windows configuration:

* Adjustment on converting HTML to RTF
  Related to UTF8 system codepage
  
  * Note that currently KeyNote relies on Windows WebBrowser component to make conversions from HTML to RTF, 
    copying the HTML text to clipboard. For the tests done, that component doesn't offer the converted RTF format
  	when system codepage is UTF8 (65001). Note also that this option is marked as Beta in W10 and W11.
	This implies that text copied from web browsers is always pasted as plain text.
	However it seems to be situations where this conversions still works with UTF8, and perhaps it depends on the 
	regional language (at least as I think I understand it from what is indicated in some issues, like #629 --Problem with text coding )
	I want to continue studying this issue and, if possible, look for an alternative way to do the conversion that 
	is not affected by the system codepage

* Disabled for now the insertion of a hyperlink when pasting image from a web browser
  Perhaps it will be restored and used if enabled via a new INI configuration option
  Currently it could add the link with the source ok but with an incorrect Alt text.
