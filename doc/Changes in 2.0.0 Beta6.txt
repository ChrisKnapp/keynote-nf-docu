Changes in 2.0.0 Beta 6  (17 nov 2024)
=======================

* Fixed bug introduced in Beta 3: exception trying to remove a folder

* Fixed exception when trying to change the tree layout (vertical vs horizontal) in the folder properties dialogue

* Fixed: Main toolbar position was ignored when opening application
  Problem was related to the use of TIniFile by the control Toolbar97. Changing to TMemIniFile solves the problem

* Fixed dynamic resize of combo control in Find All

- - - -

* Tree filter position is adapted to tree panel layout
  If the tree layout is vertical, the tree filter panel is located on the right, not taking up the entire width 
  of the tree (except if the width of the tree panel is less than a certain value).

* Change in behavior of ESC in the Scratch window
  Pressing ESC in Scratchpad editor will minimize the application and not return focus to note editor,
  *if* [Configuration Options|General settings|Program hotkey | On Escape key = Minimize Main Window].
  If 'On Escape' is not configured in that way, pressing ESC will focus the note editor, as before.

  See the reasons in discussion "Pressing ESC in Scratchpad editor" (#744)
