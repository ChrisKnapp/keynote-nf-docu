Changes in 1.8.1 Beta 1 - Beta 6  (11 nov 2023 -- 09 dec 2023)
=================================

* NEW: Significant improvement in image management
   - Support for GIF, PNG, JPG, TIF, BMP, WMF, EMF and ICO  
   - Several image storage options: EmbeddedRTF, EmbeddedKNT, External (Zip or Folder), ExternalAndEmbeddedKNT
   - Image viewer
   - It is possible to change the visibility of the images in the file
   Options:
   * ImgDefaultFormatFromClipb, ImgRatioSizePngVsJPG, ImgCompressionQuality, ImgBmpPixelFormat
   * ImgFormatInsideRTF  
   * ImgMaxAutoWidthGoal	 
   * ImgDefaultLinkMode, ImgLinkRelativePath					  					  
   * ImgUseRecycleBin
   * ImgSaveInSubfolders, Keep original file name
   * ImgSingleViewerInstance, ImgHotTrackViewer, ImgViewerPath
     
   ** A detailed explanation of the image management changes is available in "Images_Readme.txt"

* Drag and drop directly to Editor's content
  Now it is possible to drag and drop any file into the editor's own content, in a specific position.
  - A new option is offered from the import window: "Insert content at caret position"


* Added option to replace bullets by alternative string when pasting as plain text

    By default, Windows replace bullets by a symbol in Cambria Math (something like a big point) plus a tab character
    In RTF it is of the form:
    \f1\u10625?\f0\tab One
    \f1\u10625?\f0\tab Two

    With the new option is possible to replace the symbol and tab characters by other text. By default it is set to "" (empty string)
    but can be configured (in keynote.ini) with something like " - ", for example.

    [EditorOptions]
    ...
    BulletsInPlainText=" - "

    Issue related: #612 don't copy bullets to other apps
	

* Improvements for profiles management | Profiles\Default | Profiles macros
	The following improvements have been incorporated to better organize the different files that are used in each profile/session
	(See the file 'Profiles.txt') :

	- If KeyNote detects the presence of the "Profiles\Default" subfolder within the folder with the executable (keynote.exe), it will
	  search in that subfolder for the keynote.ini file and the rest of the files (and if they do not exist, it will add them to that
	  folder according to is requiring it)
	  The setup program will establish that subfolder to promote better organization of the files, avoiding mixing and confusing those
	  files with the rest of the application files and with the configurations of other profiles. The rest of the profiles should also
	  be created within the "Profiles" folder. Ex: "Profiles\F9"
	  The setup program will appropriately set the permissions for the Profiles folder.

	- The notehead.rtf and nodehead.rtf files so far have not been specific to the profile configuration, but common to all.
	  From the new version it is possible to customize one or both files from a profile, adding them to the folder containing the
	  profile's .ini file. If one of these two files is not found in the profile folder, the application will use the one(s) located
	  in the main profile folder ("Profiles\Default" or the folder that contains the executable).

	- If within the folder with the .ini files there is a subfolder called 'macros' (e.g. "Profiles\F9\macros"), the macros contained
	  therein will be loaded, taking preference over those loaded from the main macro folder (<exe folder>\macros)
		- This allows to define different automatic execution macros in each configuration.
		- When recording new macros it is possible to create them as general or specific to the profile
	

* Fixed: KNT could get hang doing a Search (Find Next or Find All) [IMPORTANT]
  It would depend on the presence of several hidden marks in the editor (vinculated to new KNT links or images --since 1.8.1),
  the distance between them and the length of the search term...
  This error is present since version 1.8.0
	
* Fixed issue #617: Access violation on exit
  
  Problem was related to the encoding of file .mgr
  At the same time has been corrected the names of the files shown in File | Recent file
  (similar problem, encoding of .mru file)

* Fixed issue #621: "Allow only one instance" not working

* Fixed: Text selection with Shift + left cursor is canceled when crossing a hidden mark

* Fixed: Convert '&quot;' to '"' in title from web pages
  (Related to commit 'Titles from web pages: convert HTML Ascii codes' (5f9dc27e12))

* Fixed: newly added nodes do not respect the established zoom

* Fixed: New KNT Links could jump to an incorrect position

    KNT links that point to a hidden mark look for a certain pattern and ID bookmark. When the application copies text to the
    clipboard, it removes the hidden bookmarks. Not doing so could make that if we pasted the text above the one we were pointing to,
    the link will find the hidden mark before the correct one. (On the contrary, the cutting operation does need that hidden mark.)

    In normal situations, the hidden mark is maintained by the control RichEdit as we inserted it. But I have found that RichEdit
    can alter some of them, adding control tags within the block that we have bounded between \v and \v0 (actually through {\v....} ).

    (This is a problem only when we are looking for the hidden marks through RTF syntax. In most situations, KNT works directly with
    hidden characters)

    We may find that an added tag like:
        ...    \v\''11B2\''12\v0 HELLO
    it ends up appearing for example as:
        \v\f0\fs16\lang3082\''11B2\''12\v0 HELLO

    We must convert:
      "\v\f0\fs16\lang3082\''11B2\''12\v0 HELLO"   ->  "\f0\fs16\lang3082 HELLO"

    * Minor changes (mainly code style), minor correction in AlertMng

    A small reduction in the size of the executable was obtained.

    
* Fixed: Possible exception on exporting (File | Copy To...  or File | Export... with KNT format ) when including plaintext notes

	
* Improvement/correction to the RemoveKNTHIddenCharactersInRTF procedure
* Other minor adjustments
