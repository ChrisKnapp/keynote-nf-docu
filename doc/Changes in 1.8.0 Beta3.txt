Changes in 1.8.0 Beta 3  (20/08/2023)
=======================

* Fixed: (Important) Text files imported as a new note note could be saved plain, not RTF

  This problem exists in KNT from the beginning, but with the changes included from version 1.8.0
  could be much more problematic, when loading the .knt file

  When importing a file with plain text into a new note, we must ensure that the note's stream is loaded with its RTF
  conversion, to avoid ending up saving that note's stream content in plain format to the .knt file when saving.
  This could occur if we didn't modify the text of that new note before saving the file.

  This was fixed when importing as nodes, but not applied also for files imported as notes (...!)
  Was corrected for importing as nodes in Commit ac672bb258... 11/06/23:
  * Fixed: Ensure that all nodes in a RTF tree note are saved in RTF format,
    and all nodes in a plain text only tree note are saved in plain format.

* New: pressing [Ctrl] + <Hide Tree Panel> will temporarily preserve editor width, reducing the application window width

  When the user hides the Tree Panel pressing Ctrl (usually: Ctr + Shift+F11  or Ctrl + [View | Tree Panel] ) then,
  instead of letting the editor panel grow to the left occuping the width of the tree panel, the application window will
  reduce its width temporarily so that the editor maintain its width and position.
 
  Once shown the Tree panel again, the application window's size and position will be restored.
 
  If, after hiding the tree panel in this way (the window's width is now reduced), the user selects another note, then
  the application will automatically make the tree panel visible and restore the aplication window width, before changing
  to the other note.
 
  Opening onother file or closing the application while the windows's width is reduced, will restore it to it's correct size.
 
  This functionality can be disabled in keynote.ini, with: IgnoreCtrHideTrePanel = 1
