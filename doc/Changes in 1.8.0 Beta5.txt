Changes in 1.8.0 Beta 5  (04/09/2023)
=======================

* Fixed: Selection of search result (from "Find All") was not working in RichEdit <=4

  See problem described here: https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/602#issuecomment-1704371949
  This problem was specific of version 1.8.0 of KeyNote. In previous versions the results of 'Find All'
  were not shown in a RichEdit control. From 1.8.0 it is used to offer excerpts that show a context for
  each coincidence.
  It is a bug in RichEdit v4, but the new solution will work ok in that old version and current ones.


* Improved click options on hyperlinks

  Now right-click on a hyperlink will always show the prompt window (to edit, modify or open)
  Added a new option to define the action on CTRL + Click

* Added numbering to serch results
