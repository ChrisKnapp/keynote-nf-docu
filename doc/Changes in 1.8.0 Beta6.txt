Changes in 1.8.0 Beta 6  (06/09/2023)
=======================

* New: View | Alternative Margins

   Allows switching between default (minimum) and defined margins in .ini
   New options define text margins in pixels:

    MarginAltLeft =80
    MarginAltRight=80

   (As suggested in https://github.com/dpradov/keynote-nf/issues/602#issuecomment-1685401368 )

* Fixed: An exception "Cannot open clipboard: Access Denied" could occasionally be raised
  In that cases the message could be accepted without closing the app, but could be annoying.

* Fixed: Error loading Glossary list
